# Peristaltic Pump – JIH 253Yx-JBT

![Pump Preview](Pump.png)

## Overview
The **JIH 253Yx-JBT Peristaltic Pump** is engineered for **precise, contamination-free liquid transfer** in food processing, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and laboratory environments. Its peristaltic mechanism ensures that the pumped fluid **never contacts internal components**, making it ideal for sterile, hygienic, and chemically sensitive applications.  

This model supports **accurate dosing**, ingredient dispensing, flavor injection, and chemical transfer, while meeting demanding sanitary and regulatory requirements common in automated food-production systems.

## Purpose and Application
This peristaltic pump is designed for applications requiring **consistent, sterile, and highly controlled fluid movement**, including:

- Micro-dosing in automated food systems  
- Ingredient dispensing and flavor-injection  
- Chemical and reagent transfer in lab environments  
- Biotech and pharmaceutical fluid handling  
- Continuous flow control with minimal contamination risk  

Its isolated-flow design enables **repeatable dosing**, smooth operation, and rapid cleaning workflows, making it suitable for both production and experimental setups.

## Design Details
**Specifications**
- **Rotor Assembly:** Multi-roller head minimizes tubing fatigue, reduces pulsation, and delivers smooth, consistent flow  
- **Housing:** Made from chemical-resistant polymers or light alloys designed to withstand cleaning agents and mild corrosives  
- **Drive System:** Compact DC or stepper motor with controlled speed range for precision dosing  
- **Mounting Configuration:** Side-mount or panel-mount options for seamless integration into food, lab, or automated machinery  
- **Tubing Interface:** Compatible with standard peristaltic tubing; snap-fit or clamp-style system supports quick replacement  
- **Sealing & Protection:** Enclosed motor housing protects sensitive electronics from moisture and washdown environments  
- **Service Strategy:** Tubing is the primary wear component, enabling maintenance without disassembling the pump body  

**Key Features**
- Self-priming peristaltic mechanism prevents backflow without complex valving  
- Full fluid isolation ensures sterility and contamination-free operation  
- Adjustable flow rate through speed control and tubing-size selection  
- Reversible flow direction for purge, line clearing, and bidirectional systems  
- Tool-free tubing changeout for rapid production or lab transitions  
- Excellent for viscous or particulate-light fluids used in food, bioprocessing, and lab workflows  
- Low maintenance: no seals, diaphragms, or wetted internal components
